# README: Understanding and Utilizing Regular Expressions (Regex)

## Overview

This repository provides an introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex), a vital tool for text processing in programming. Regex is used for searching, validating, replacing, and parsing text. This README covers basic concepts, a practical example of using regex in Python to parse CSV files for phone numbers, and outlines common regex patterns.

## Introduction to Regex

Regular expressions provide a concise and flexible means for "matching" strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. Regex is commonly used in data validation, data extraction, and string parsing.

### Capabilities of Regex
- **Searching**: Locate specific sequences within text.
- **Validation**: Ensure text meets a desired format.
- **Substitution**: Replace text.
- **Extraction**: Pull specific data from a structured text.

## Setting Up the Environment

To work with the examples in this repository, ensure you have Python installed on your system. We use Python's built-in `re` module for regex operations and `csv` for handling CSV files.

## Basic Regex Example in Python

```python
import re

# Example text
text = "Contact: example@email.com"

# Regex pattern for an email
email_pattern = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'

# Finding the email in the text
found_emails = re.findall(email_pattern, text)

print(found_emails)  # Output: ['example@email.com']
```

This basic example demonstrates how to use a regex pattern to find email addresses in a text string.

## CSV Parsing Example

Here, we demonstrate how to extract phone numbers from a CSV file using regex.

```python
import csv
import re

# Regex pattern for a standard phone number format
phone_pattern = r'\b\d{3}[-.\s]??\d{3}[-.\s]??\d{4}\b'

# Reading a CSV and extracting phone numbers
with open('contacts.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        phones = re.findall(phone_pattern, row[0])  # Assuming the first column contains phone numbers
        print(phones)
```

---

## Common Regex Patterns

- **Email Addresses**: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`
- **URLs**: `http[s]?://...` (truncated for brevity)
- **Phone Numbers**: `\b\d{3}[-.\s]??\d{3}[-.\s]??\d{4}\b`
- **IP Addresses**, **HTML Tags**, **Dates**, **Postal Codes**, **Credit Card Numbers** and more...
